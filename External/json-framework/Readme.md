SBJson (aka json-framework)
===========================

JSON is a light-weight data interchange format that's easy to read and
write for humans and computers alike. This framework implements
a strict JSON parser and generator in Objective-C.

Features
--------

* BSD license.
* Easy-to-use API.
* Strict parsing & generation.
* Streaming JSON support. Start parsing a JSON document before it has finished downloading from the server!
* Supports garbage collection, but does not require it.
* Optional pretty-printing of JSON output.
* Optional sorted dictionary keys in JSON output.
* Configurable recursion depth limit for added security.

Simple Installation
===================

The simplest way to start using JSON in your application is to simply
copy all the source files (the contents of the `Classes` folder) into
your own Xcode project.

1. In the Finder, navigate to the `$PATH_TO_SBJSON/Classes` folder and select all the files.
1. Drop-and-drop them into your Xcode project.
1. Tick the **Copy items into destination group's folder** option.
1. Use `#import "SBJsonInclude.h"` in  your source files (or simply include the particular classes you wish to use.

That should be it. Now create that Twitter client!

Upgrading
---------

If you're upgrading from a previous version, make sure you're deleting the old SBJson classes first, moving all the files to Trash.

Install API documentation into Xcode
====================================

From the top-level project directory, run the `./InstallDocumentation.sh` program. This compiles the documentation and installs it so it integrates with Xcode. Now open Xcode documentation and search for SBJson. You should see a lot of the classes. (Generating the documentation requires [Doxygen](http://doxygen.org) to be installed.)


Alternative installation instructions
=====================================

Copying the SBJson classes into your project isn't the only way to use this framework. (Though it is the simplest.) I've created a couple of examples that link to this framework rather than copy the sources. Check them out at github:
